# Brain-Tumor-Classification

Experimentation on a Kaggle dataset to classify brain tumors in human brain MRI images The dataset consists of four classes: glioma, meningioma, no tumor, and pituitary. Various deep neural network-based architectures, including CNN, VGG19, RestNet50, and InceptionV3, were employed to compare model performance.
